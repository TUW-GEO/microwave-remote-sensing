Given the multiple scattering contributions originating from the various elementary objects present within a resolution cell, the resulting backscatter signal can be described as a random constructive and destructive interference of wavelets. As a consequence, speckle is the reason why a granular pattern normally affects SAR images, making it more challenging to interpret and analyze them.\n",
