    "Not only radar reflectivity vary according to different land cover classes. The backscattered signal also depends on the change of the imagined natural media over time. We may want to capture in one single image how different land covers comparably change across the same time range. A way to do achieve that is by generating a RGB composite. But what is a RGB composite? It all comes down to combining three image bands into one picture by setting each band as either Red, Green or Blue channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to highlight the temporal variability of the backscatter response, we want to select 3 images with maximal distance in time. Therefore we take the first, the middle and the last time available out of the input images available for this exercise. We use RGB coloring where we want to color the first image with Red, the second with Green and the Third with Blue color. When we overlay the images the color will show the differences over time."

The first step is to convert the backscattering values into linear scale so we can perform meaningful calculations. Now we can normalise the values to be between 0 and 1 using the following formula:\n",

Due to the nature of backscattering some sigma nought values get very high so taking the 98th quantile is important. The linear backscattering values are bounded by 0 so using for example the 2nd quantile is not necessary. After applying the formula, any values exceeding the 98th quantile will be greater than 1. We map these values to 1 to ensure they fit within our specified range.\""
