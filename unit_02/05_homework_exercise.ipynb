    "We will try to highlight the difference between cross- and co-polarized microwave backscattering for Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 separately. As already indicated volume scattering leads to depolarization effects, where multiple scattering can cause a change in polarization. Hence, a cross-polarized receiving antenna, such as on-board the Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 satellites, may receive less energy from smooth bare soils than from vegetated surfaces. And the received energy for a cross-polarized receiving antenna will increase with increasing vegetation density. Hence this property of depolarization with vegetation density can be formulated as the *cross-polarised ratio*.\n",

The boxplot uses boxes to illustrate the distributions of binned LAI values. Box limits indicate the range of the central 50% of the data (a.k.a inter quartile range: IQR), with the median value depicted as a central red line. The whisker limits demarcate 1.5 times the distance of the IQR. Values outside of the whiskers are considered outliers. Outliers have been eliminated in this plot to make the plot more readable."
