Moreover, the notebook illustrates the importance and impact of geometric and radiometric terrain correction. As the processing of SAR data is a very time and hardware-intense task, we won’t perform the actual processing in this notebook. Instead, data at different processing steps is illustrated to highlight the impact of the processing steps.\nWe first load our data from the following intake catalog.

This corrects for at least one typically occurring distortion in mountainous regions: “foreshortening”.\nFigure 3: Side Looking radar distortions (script Chapter 4).\nForeshortening can be spotted by eye, as it often has a radiometric consequence, where unusually bright areas fringe mountain ridges; a phenomenon called “highlighting”. This geometric artifact occurs due to the compression of the distance in the image of slopes facing the radar system and the consequentially higher density of scatterers per unit length. Now let’s zoom in on an example from the same datacube and display the original and corrected values side-by-side.\nfor_dc = gtc_dc.sel(x=slice(9.651, 9.706), y=slice(47.134, 47.079)).band_data\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 8))\n\nbbox = {\"boxstyle\": \"round\", \"fc\": \"0.8\"}\narrowprops = {\"facecolor\": \"red\", \"shrink\": 0.05}\n\nax[1].annotate(\n    \"foreshortening/layover\",\n    xy=(9.674, 47.092),\n    xytext=(0.574, 0.192),\n    textcoords=\"subfigure fraction\",\n    bbox=bbox,\n    arrowprops=arrowprops,\n)\nax[1].annotate(\n    \"radar shadows\",\n    xy=(9.68, 47.119),\n    xytext=(0.6, 0.625),\n    textcoords=\"subfigure fraction\",\n    bbox=bbox,\n    arrowprops=arrowprops,\n)\n\nax[0].axes.set_aspect(\"equal\")\nax[1].axes.set_aspect(\"equal\")\n\nfor_dc.sel(band=\"grd\").plot(ax=ax[0], robust=True, cmap=\"Greys_r\")\nfor_dc.sel(band=\"sig0_gtc\").plot(ax=ax[1], robust=True, cmap=\"Greys_r\")\nFigure 4: Close-up inspection of geometric distortions in side-looking radar\nAs we can see, not all the geometric distortions can be corrected by the algorithm. Some of the pixels at the mountain ranges appear stretched, as in these areas not enough valid measurements are available. Moreover, we can see dark areas which are indicating radar shadows. These are image areas that could not be captured by the radar sensor and have values close to the noise floor of the Sensor (minimum detectable signal strength) ~ -28dB. It is important to note, that radar shadows are not the same for every image, as they depend on the acquisition geometry, in particular, the incidence angle and the flight direction of the satellite.",

The difference is the plane of the reference area, which is the ground area as a tangent on an ellipsoidal Earth model for \\(\\sigma^0_E\\) and perpendicular to the line of sight for \\(\\gamma^0_E\\) (Figure 5). For this, we load a new datacube which includes \\(\\sigma^0_E\\) and the Incidence Angle for each pixel.

We can see, that it depicts the differences between near to far range, but not the actual terrain as it refers to the ellipsoid. The slight patterns of the terrain that are visible are originating from the geometric terrain correction. We will use this information now to convert our (\\(\\sigma^0_E\\) to \\(\\gamma^0_E\\)) with the following equation (equation 6.20 in the script):\n\\[ \\gamma^0_E = \\sigma^0_E / \\cos(\\theta_i) \\]\nWe can perform this transformation with basic numpy operations on the xarray datacube.\n\n# linear scale\nsig0_db = coef_dc.sel(band=\"sig0_gtc\") / 10\nsig0_lin = 10 ** (coef_dc.sel(band=\"sig0_gtc\") / 10)\n# conversion to gamma\ngam0_lin = sig0_lin / np.cos(np.radians(coef_dc.sel(band=\"incidence_angle\")))\n# dB scale\ngam0_db = 10 * np.log(gam0_lin)\n# add to existing cube\ncoef_dc = xr.concat(\n    [coef_dc.sel(band=\"sig0_gtc\"), gam0_db.expand_dims(band=[\"gam0_gtc\"])],\n    dim=\"band\",\n)\n\ncoef_dc.hvplot.image(\n    x=\"x\",\n    y=\"y\",\n    robust=False,\n    data_aspect=1,\n    cmap=\"Greys_r\",\n    groupby=\"band\",\n    rasterize=True,\n).opts(frame_height=600, framewise=False, aspect=\"equal\")\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: \\(\\sigma^0_E\\), and \\(\\gamma^0_E\\) can be selected on the right-hand side of the graphic.\nComparing \\(\\sigma^0_E\\) and \\(\\gamma^0_E\\) in the figure, we can see that both look identical except for the range. This is because the only difference between \\(\\sigma^0_E\\) and \\(\\gamma^0_E\\) is the change of the reference area. While \\(\\sigma^0_E\\) is defined to be ground range, \\(\\gamma^0_E\\) is defined to be in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight from the sensor. This way, \\(\\gamma^0_E\\) mitigates the impact of the incidence angle. However, \\(\\gamma^0_E\\) is still based on the ellipsoid and does not account for the impact of the terrain on the radiometry.",

    "text": "2.1 Loading Data\nIn this notebook we discuss how we can easily compare images of two or more different time slices, satellites or other earth observation products. We limit our selves to products on a regular grid with an associated coordinate reference system (CRS), known as a raster. This means that each cell of the raster contains an attribute value and location coordinates. The process of combining such rasters to form datacubes is called raster stacking. We can have datacubes in many forms, such as the spatiotemporal datacube:\n\\[Z = f(x,y,t) \\quad \\text{,}\\]\nor when dealing with electromagnetic spectrum, the spectral wavelengths may form an additional dimension of a cube:\n\\[Z = f(x,y,t, \\lambda ) \\quad \\text{.} \\]\nWe also have already encountered the case where \\(Z\\) consists of multiple variables, such as seen in the xarray dataset.\n\\[{Z_1,Z_2,...,Z_3} = f(x,y,t) \\]\nTo perform raster stacking, we generally follow a certain routine (see also Figure 1).\nTo get the same projection, resolution, and region we have to resample one (or more) products. The desired projection, resolution, and region can be adopted from one of the original rasters or it can be a completely new projection of the data.\nFigure 1: Stacking of arrays to form datacubes (source: https://eox.at).\nIn this notebook we will study two different SAR products. SAR data from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (Alos-2), which is a Japanese Satellite platform with an L-band sensor (PALSAR-2) from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and C-band data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission. It is our goal to compare C- with L-band, so we need to somehow stack these arrays.\nBefore loading the data into memory we will first look at the area covered by the Sentinel-1 dataset on a map. This way we can select a region of interest for our hypothetical study. We will extract and transform the bounds of the data to longitude and latitude.\nbbox = xr.open_mfdataset(\n    make_gitlab_urls(\"sentinel-1\"),\n    engine=\"rasterio\",\n    combine=\"nested\",\n    concat_dim=\"band\",\n).rio.transform_bounds(\"EPSG:4326\")\n\nbbox = box(*bbox)\n\narea_map = folium.Map(\n    max_bounds=True,\n    location=[bbox.centroid.y, bbox.centroid.x],\n    scrollWheelZoom=False,\n)\n\n# bounds of image\nfolium.GeoJson(mapping(bbox), name=\"Area of Interest\", color=\"red\").add_to(area_map)\n\n# minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, maximum latitude\narea_of_interest = box(10.3, 45.5, 10.6, 45.6)\n\nfolium.GeoJson(mapping(area_of_interest), name=\"Area of Interest\").add_to(area_map)\n\narea_map\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\nFigure 2: Map of study area. Red rectangle is the area covered by the Sentinel-1 raster. Blue rectangle is the area of interest.\nOn the map we have drawn rectangles of the area covered by the images and of our selected study area. To prevent loading too much data we will now only load the data as defined by the blue rectangle on the folium map.\nThe Sentinel-1 data is now stored on disk as separate two-dimensional GeoTIFF files with a certain timestamp. The following s1_preprocess function allows to load all files in one go as a spatiotemporal datacube. Basically, the preprocessing function helps reading the timestamp from the file and adds this as a new dimension to the array. The latter allows a concatenation procedure where all files are joined along the new time dimension. In addition by providing area_of_interest.bounds to the parameter bbox we will only load the data of the previously defined area of interest.\ndef s1_preprocess(\n    x: xr.Dataset,\n    bbox: tuple[float, float, float, float],\n    scale: float,\n) -&gt; xr.Dataset:\n    \"\"\"Preprocess file.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : xarray.Dataset\n      Input raster\n    bbox: tuple\n      Minimum longitude minimum latitude maximum longitude maximum latitude\n    scale: float\n      Scaling factor\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    xarray.Dataset : Output stacked raster\n\n    \"\"\"\n    path = Path(urllib.parse.unquote_plus(x.encoding[\"source\"]))\n    filename = path.parent.name\n    x = x.rio.clip_box(*bbox, crs=\"EPSG:4326\")\n\n    date_str = filename.split(\"_\")[0][1:]\n    time_str = filename.split(\"_\")[1][:6]\n    datetime_str = date_str + time_str\n    date = pd.to_datetime(datetime_str, format=\"%Y%m%d%H%M%S\")\n    x = x.expand_dims(dim={\"time\": [date]})\n\n    x = (\n        x.rename({\"band_data\": \"s1_\" + path.parent.parent.stem})\n        .squeeze(\"band\")\n        .drop_vars(\"band\")\n    )\n\n    return x * scale\nWe load the data again with open_mfdataset and by providing the preprocess function, including the bounds of the area of interest and the scaling factor, as follows:\npartial_ = partial(s1_preprocess, bbox=area_of_interest.bounds, scale=0.01)\n\ns1_ds = xr.open_mfdataset(\n    make_gitlab_urls(\"sentinel-1\"),\n    engine=\"rasterio\",\n    combine=\"nested\",\n    chunks=-1,\n    preprocess=partial_,\n    compat=\"no_conflicts\",\n    join=\"outer\",\n)",

This grid provides equal-area tiles, meaning each tile represents the same area, which helps reducing distorsions. This feature is important for remote sensing as it reduces the so-called oversampling due to geometric distortions when projecting on a sphere. This particular projection is developed by TUWien.\nNow we will proceed with loading the ALOS-2 L-band data in much the same fashion as for Sentinel-1. Again timeslices are stored separately as individual GeoTIFFS and they need to be concatenated along the time dimension. We use a slightly different preprocessing function alos_preprocess for this purpose. The most notable difference of this function is the inclusion of a scaling factor for the 16-bit digital numbers (DN):\n\\[\\gamma^0_T = 10 * log_{10}(\\text{DN}^2) - 83.0 \\,dB\\]\nto correctly convert the integers to \\(\\gamma^0_T\\) in the dB range.\n\ndef alos_preprocess(\n    x: xr.Dataset,\n    bbox: tuple[float, float, float, float],\n) -&gt; xr.Dataset:\n    \"\"\"Preprocess file.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : xarray.Dataset\n      Input raster\n    bbox: tuple\n      minimum longitude minimum latitude maximum longitude maximum latitude\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    xarray.Dataset : Output stacked raster\n\n    \"\"\"\n    path = Path(urllib.parse.unquote_plus(x.encoding[\"source\"]))\n    filename = path.parent.name\n    x = x.rio.clip_box(*bbox, crs=\"EPSG:4326\")\n\n    date_str = filename.split(\"_\")[0][15:22]\n    date = pd.to_datetime(date_str, format=\"%y%m%d\")\n    x = x.expand_dims(dim={\"time\": [date]})\n\n    x = (\n        x.rename({\"band_data\": \"alos_\" + path.parent.parent.stem})\n        .squeeze(\"band\")\n        .drop_vars(\"band\")\n    )\n\n    # conversion to dB scale of alos\n    return 10 * np.log10(x**2) - 83.0\n\nNow we load the data with the open_mfdataset function of xarray and we provide the preprocessing function (see above), which includes the selection of the bounds of an area of interest and the extraction of time stamps from the file name.\n\narea_of_interest = affinity.scale(area_of_interest, xfact=1.7, yfact=1.7)\npartial_ = partial(alos_preprocess, bbox=area_of_interest.bounds)\n\nalos_ds = xr.open_mfdataset(\n    make_gitlab_urls(\"alos-2\"),\n    engine=\"rasterio\",\n    combine=\"nested\",\n    chunks=-1,\n    preprocess=partial_,\n    compat=\"no_conflicts\",\n    join=\"outer\",\n)\n\nAlso, for this dataset we will look at the metadata in order to compare it with Sentinel-1.\n\nprint_raster(alos_ds, \"ALOS-2\")\n\nALOS-2 Raster: \n----------------\nresolution: (25.0, -25.0) ('metre', 1.0)\nbounds: (593137.5, 5035287.5, 633312.5, 5054912.5)\nCRS: EPSG:32632",

    "text": "2.3 Reprojecting\nThe ALOS-2 is projected on an UTM grid. We would therefore like to reproject this data to match the projection of Sentinel-1. Furthermore, we will upsample the data to match the Sentinel-1 sampling. The rioxarray package has a very convenient method that can do this all in one go:reproject_match. For continuous data it is best to use a bilinear resampling strategy. As always you have to consider again that we deal with values in the dB range, so we need to convert to the linear scale before bilinear resampling.\n\nalos_ds_lin = 10 ** (alos_ds / 10)\nalos_ds_lin = alos_ds_lin.rio.reproject_match(\n    s1_ds,\n    resampling=Resampling.bilinear,\n)\nalos_ds = 10 * np.log10(alos_ds_lin)\n\nWe will overwrite the coordinate values of ALOS-2 with those of Sentinel-1.

canopies. So high LAI is interpreted as forested area, whereas low values account for less vegetated areas (shrubs, grass-land, and crops).\nFirst we’ll have a look at the mean and standard deviation of LAI over all timeslices. This can be achieved by using the mean and std methods of the xarray object and by supplying a dimension over which these aggregating operations will be applied. We use the dimension “time”, thereby flattening the cube to a 2-D array with dimensions x and y.\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 6))\n\nLAI_dc = fused_ds.LAI\nLAI_mean = LAI_dc.mean(\"time\")\nLAI_std = LAI_dc.std(\"time\")\n\nLAI_mean.plot(ax=ax[0], vmin=0, vmax=6).axes.set_aspect(\"equal\")\nLAI_std.plot(ax=ax[1], vmin=0, vmax=3).axes.set_aspect(\"equal\")\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n/home/runner/work/microwave-remote-sensing/microwave-remote-sensing/.conda_envs/microwave-remote-sensing/lib/python3.13/site-packages/dask/array/numpy_compat.py:58: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide\n  x = np.divide(x1, x2, out)\nFigure 1: Map of mean LAI (left) and the associated standard deviation (right) for each pixel over time around Lake Garda.\nIt appears that the northern parts of our study area contain more and variable amounts of green elements per unit area.

    "text": "3.2 Timeseries\nNow that we have detected possible forested areas, let’s delve a bit deeper into the data. Remember that we deal with a spatiotemporal datacube. This gives us the possibility to study changes for each time increment. Hence we can show what happens to LAI for areas marked with generally low values as well as high values. We can achieve this by filtering the datacube with the where method for areas marked with low and high mean LAI values. In turn we will aggregate the remaining datacube over the spatial dimensions (“x” and “y”) to get a mean values for each time increment.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 4))\n\nthreshold = 4\nLAI_low = LAI_dc.where(LAI_mean &lt; threshold)\nLAI_high = LAI_dc.where(LAI_mean &gt; threshold)\n\nLAI_low.mean([\"x\", \"y\"]).plot.scatter(x=\"time\", ax=ax[0], ylim=(0, 6))\nLAI_high.mean([\"x\", \"y\"]).plot.scatter(x=\"time\", ax=ax[1], ylim=(0, 6))\nax[0].set_title(\"Low Mean LAI ($\\\\bar{LAI} &lt; {threshold}$)\")\nax[1].set_title(\"High Mean LAI ($\\\\bar{LAI} &gt; {threshold}$)\")\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Timeseries of mean LAI per timeslice for areas with low (left) and high (right) mean LAI of Figure1.\nNow we can see that areas with high mean LAI values (Figure 1) show a drop-off to values as low as those for areas with low mean LAI during the autumn months (Figure 2 ; right panel). Hence we might deduce that we deal with deciduous forest that becomes less green during autumn, as can be expected for the study area.\nRemember that longer wavelengths like L-bands are more likely to penetrate through a forest canopy and would interact more readily with larger object like tree trunks and the forest floor. In turn, C-band microwaves are more likely to interact with sparse and shrub vegetation. The polarization of the emitted and received microwaves is on the other hand dependent on the type of backscattering with co-polarization (HH and VV) happening more frequently with direct backscatter or double bounce scattering. Whereas volume scattering occurs when the radar signal is subject to multiple reflections within 3-dimensional matter, as the orientation of the main scatterers is random, the polarization of the backscattered signal is also random. Volume scattering can therefore cause an increase of cross-polarized intensity.\nLet’s put this to the test by checking the microwave backscatter signatures over forested and sparsely vegetated areas as well as water bodies (Lake Garda). Let’s first look at the different sensor readings for the beginning of summer and autumn.\n\nhv.output(widget_location=\"bottom\")\n\nt1 = (\n    fused_ds.gam0.isel(time=2)\n    .hvplot.image(\n        robust=True,\n        data_aspect=1,\n        cmap=\"Greys_r\",\n        rasterize=True,\n        clim=(-25, 0),\n    )\n    .opts(frame_height=400, aspect=\"equal\")\n)\n\nt2 = (\n    fused_ds.gam0.isel(time=-1)\n    .hvplot.image(\n        robust=True,\n        data_aspect=1,\n        cmap=\"Greys_r\",\n        rasterize=True,\n        clim=(-25, 0),\n    )\n    .opts(frame_height=400, aspect=\"equal\")\n)\n\nt1 + t2\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Maps of Sentinel-1 and Alos-2 \\(\\gamma^0_T \\,[dB]\\) for the beginning of summer (left) and autumn (right).\nThe most notable difference is the lower energy received for cross-polarized than for co-polarized microwaves for both Sentinel-1 and Alos-2. The latter differences are independent of the time of year. However, one can also note small changes in the received energy for the same satellite dependent on the time of year. To get a better feel for these changes over time we generate the following interactive plot. On the following plot one can select areas of a certain mean LAI (by clicking on the map) and see the associated timeseries of \\(\\gamma^0_T\\) for each of the sensors.\n\nLAI_image = LAI_mean.hvplot.image(rasterize=True, cmap=\"viridis\", clim=(0, 6)).opts(\n    title=\"Mean LAI (Selectable)\",\n    frame_height=400,\n    aspect=\"equal\",\n)\n\n\ndef get_timeseries(x: float, y: float) -&gt; hv.Scatter:\n    \"\"\"Plot LAI timeseries.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x: float\n        numeric value for x selected on LAI map\n    y: float\n        numeric value for y selected on LAI map\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    hvplot.Scatter : LAI timeseries plot\n\n    \"\"\"\n    lai_value = LAI_mean.sel(x=x, y=y, method=\"nearest\").values\n\n    if np.isnan(lai_value):\n        select = fused_ds.where(LAI_mean.isnull())\n        label = \"Water\"\n    else:\n        mask = np.isclose(LAI_mean, lai_value, atol=0.05)\n        select = fused_ds.where(mask)\n        label = \"Mean LAI: \" + str(np.round(lai_value, 1))\n\n    return (\n        select.gam0.to_dataset(\"sensor\")\n        .median([\"x\", \"y\"], skipna=True)\n        .hvplot.scatter(ylim=(-30, 5))\n        .opts(title=label, frame_height=400)\n    )\n\n\npoint_stream = hv.streams.SingleTap(source=LAI_image)\ntime_series = hv.DynamicMap(get_timeseries, streams=[point_stream])\nLAI_image + time_series\n\n/home/runner/work/microwave-remote-sensing/microwave-remote-sensing/.conda_envs/microwave-remote-sensing/lib/python3.13/site-packages/numpy/lib/_nanfunctions_impl.py:1216: RuntimeWarning: All-NaN slice encountered\n  return fnb._ureduce(a, func=_nanmedian, keepdims=keepdims,\nWARNING:param.RasterPlot01207: Due to internal constraints, when aspect and width/height is set, the bokeh backend uses those values as frame_width/frame_height instead.

(Right) Timeseries of for Sentinel-1 and Alos-2 \\(\\gamma^0_T [dB]\\).\nCan you see some patterns when analyzing the different wavelengths and polarizations?\nRemember again that we deal with a logarithmic scale. A measurement of 10 dB is 10 times brighter than the intensity measured at 0 dB, and 100 times brighter at 20 dB. The most notable difference is that the offset between cross- and co-polarised signals becomes larger at low LAI and lower at higher LAI. This might indicate the effect of volume scattering in forested areas where co- and cross-polarization render backscattering values more equal. You will study the differences among cross- and co-polarized backscattering in more detail in the homework exercise.",

    "text": "5.1 Lake Neusiedl data\nThis notebook will provide an empirical demonstration of speckle - how it originates, how it visually and statistically looks like, and some of the most common approaches to filter it.\nSpeckle is defined as a kind of noise that affects all radar images. Given the multiple scattering contributions originating from the various elementary objects present within a resolution cell, the resulting backscatter signal can be described as a random constructive and destructive interference of wavelets. As a consequence, speckle is the reason why a granular pattern normally affects SAR images, making it more challenging to interpret and analyze them.\nCredits: ESRI\nLet’s make an example of a cornfield (with a typical backscattering value of about -10 dB). According to the following equation:\n\\[\n\\sigma^0 = \\frac{1}{\\text{area}} \\sum_{n \\in \\text{area}} \\sigma_n\n\\]\nWe should ideally have a uniform discrete sigma naught \\(\\sigma^0\\) value, given that the cornfield pixel is the only individual contributor.\nHowever, since we already learned from the previous notebooks that a pixel’s ground size can be in the order of tens of meters (i.e., 10 meters for Sentinel-1), we can imagine that different distributed targets in the scene contribute to the global backscattered information.\nLet´s replicate this behavior with an ideal uniform area constituted by 100 pixels and then by adding 30% of speckle.\nFigure 1: Synthetic data that emulates speckles in microwave backscattering\nWe can imagine that the second plot represents a real SAR acquisition over a cornfield, while the first plot represents an ideal uniform SAR image over a cornfield land (no speckle). The introduction of a simulated 30% speckle noise could be related to the presence of distributed scatterers of any sort present in the scene, which would cause a pixel-to-pixel variation in terms of intensity.\nAll the random contributions (such as the wind) would result in a different speckle pattern each time a SAR scene is acquired over the same area. Many subpixel contributors build up a complex scattered pattern in any SAR image, making it erroneous to rely on a single pixel intensity for making reliable image analysis. In order to enhance the degree of usability of a SAR image, several techniques have been put in place to mitigate speckle. We will now show two of the most common approaches: the temporal and the spatial filter.\nWe load a dataset that contains the CORINE land cover and Sentinel-1 \\(\\sigma^0_E\\) at a 20 meter resolution.

Even though speckle is known for following non-normal distributions (i.e., Rayleigh distribution for amplitude in the linear domain, and the Gumple for intensity in the log domain), we can assume that due to the Central Limit Theorem, the overall backscatter means (dB) tend to follow a Gaussian distribution.\nWe can mitigate speckle (it is impossible to remove it completely) by following approaches such as: - spatial filtering - taking mean backscatter value over the same land cover, or - temporal filtering - taking the average backscatter value over some time period.\nEither way, one pixel is never representative of ground truth!

    "text": "6.1 Single Look Complex (SLC) Data\nOn July 5th, 2019, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 mainshock struck eastern California, near the city of Ridgecrest. The seismic event produced a surface rupture spanning more than 50 kilometers with a complex vertical and horizontal offset pattern along the main fault line. SAR imagery can be employed for accurately measuring and describing ground motion through a well-established technique called SAR Interferometry. In this framework, the phase information contained in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is employed. In this notebook, we will dive into the main interferometric SAR processing operations which involves retrieving the difference between the phase signals of repeated SAR acquisitions to analyze the shape and deformation of the Earth’s surface. In our case, we will use a pair of Single Look Complex (SLC) Sentinel-1 images to obtain an interferogram of the Ridgecrest earthquake.\nThis notebook will outline the process of working with interferograms and the steps needed to extract valuable information. Here, we will focus on displaying products generated by the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software from the European Space Agency (ESA).\nPhoto by Brian Olson / California Geological Survey\nWe introduce now another level-1 radar product type, which is called Single Look Complex (SLC). Interferometry can only be performed with SLC data. What are the main differences between SLC and GRD (the other level-1 radar product)? + SLC vs GRD: + SLC contains complex-value data (amplitude and phase) vs GRD contains intensity only (amplitude) + SLC geometry is Slant Range (radar’s line of sight) vs GRD data are projected onto ground range + SLC resolution is full vs GRD has lower resolution (it is multi-looked) + SLC supports phase-based applications (Interferometry) vs GRD supports only amplitude-based ones + SLC has larger file sizes compared to GRD\nurl = get_intake_url()\ncat = intake.open_catalog(url)\niw1_ds = cat.iw1.read()\niw2_ds = cat.iw2.read()\niw3_ds = cat.iw3.read()\n\nhttps://git.geo.tuwien.ac.at/public_projects/microwave-remote-sensing/-/raw/main/microwave-remote-sensing.yml\nLet’s plot all three sub-swaths to view the full scene acquired by the satellite. The acquisition times for each swath on July 10th, 2019 are the following: - IW1 at 01:50:01 - 01:50:26 - IW2 at 01:49:59 - 01:50:24 - IW3 at 01:50:00 - 01:50:25\ndatasets = [iw1_ds, iw2_ds, iw3_ds]\n\nplot_slc_all(datasets)\nWe don’t need all three of the subswaths for our notebook, so we will focus on IW2 and display its intensity and phase measurements.\nplot_slc_iw2(iw2_ds)\nIntensity is represented in an 8-bit format (ranging from 0 to 255), while phase measurements range from \\(- \\pi\\) to \\(\\pi\\) . At first glance, phase does not correspond to easily observable physical properties of the ground. However, the phase becomes incredibly valuable when, for example, it is used comparatively between two successive phase measurements (two Sentinel-1 images acquired at different times over the same area).

    "text": "6.3 Interferogram Formation and Coherence Estimation\nThe interferogram formation process combines the amplitudes of both images and calculates the difference between their respective phases at each SAR image pixel (cross-multiplication of the master image with the complex conjugate of the slave image).\nAfter building up the interferogram, we have to take into account the presence of other contributing terms that could hinder our goal of measuring the surface deformation due to the earthquake. For example, we need to subtract from the interferogram the flat-earth phase contribution, which is a signal contribution due to the curvature of the Earth’s surface. This is here done automatically through the SNAP software operators.\nIn general, the accuracy of interferometric measurements are influenced by many contributors that could result in a loss of coherence. But what is coherence? It is a measure of phase correlation between the master and slave image. Interferometric coherence (γ) can be expressed as:\n\\[γ = γ_{proc}*γ_{geom}*γ_{vol}*γ_{SNR}*γ_{temp}\\]\nwhere \\(γ_{proc}\\) refers to inaccuracies in the processing (e.g., coregistration errors), \\(γ_{geom}\\) refers to the baseline decorrelation (different position of satellites during the two acquisitions), \\(γ_{vol}\\) refers to volume decorrelation (vegetation related), \\(γ_{SNR}\\) refers to the radar instrument thermal noise and \\(γ_{temp}\\) refers to the decorrelation caused by change of position of the objects in the scene during the time interval of the images acquisitions (e.g., plant growth, wind-induced movements or ground deformation due to earthquakes, landslides).\nTherefore, we can conclude that interferometric accuracy is sensitive to many processes, hence isolating the ground deformation signal involves several operations. On the other hand, interferometric coherence sensitivity could be exploited to track and map phenomena that cause its degradation (e.g., vegetation features, and water content).\n\ninterferogram_ds = cat.inter.read()\n\nplot_interferogram(interferogram_ds)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nNow we can observe patterns that emerged between the two acquisitions.

On the right, you find a plot of the interferometric coherence (values ranging between 0 and 1), where low coherence is found along the ground surface ruptures caused by the earthquake. Please note, that the interferogram has already undergone a deburst operation (all bursts merged into a single image).",

    "text": "6.5 Multi-looking, Goldstein Phase Filtering and Geocoding\nIn order to improve the phase signatures contained within our interferogram and get a generally higher signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, we will perform two additional operations called multi-looking and Goldstein phase filtering. Multi-looking is the process of averaging adjacent pixels using a moving window of the interferogram to reduce noise (at the cost of reducing the spatial resolution). Coherence is involved in this operation to flag and set areas to no data that are considered unreliable (low coherence) and to keep the reliable ones (high coherence).\nFinally, to make data interpretable, we geocode the wrapped interferogram. So far we performed the interferometric processing in the radar geometry. The transformation into geographic coordinates will help us to perform further comparisons in a real-world coordinate system.\n\ngeocoded_ds = cat.geocode.read()\n\nstep = 4  # if you want to zoom in, suggestion is to make this step smaller\n\nplot_igf_coh(geocoded_ds, step)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nIn the above plot, we can compare georeferenced data in the form of the interferogram (left) and the coherence (right). Along the earthquake fault line, low coherence between the two phase acquisitions is visible. This occurs due to extreme changes in terrain heights or displacements, which are beyond the sensitivity of the SAR sensor. This area of low coherence indicates higher uncertainty in the interferogram. However, this isn’t necessarily a drawback, as it helps to clearly identify the earthquake epicenter.\nYou can also explore and zoom into regions with “fringe patterns” to observe ground movement. Each fringe cycle (e.g., from red to red or blue to blue) corresponds to ground motion in this case. The fringe patterns indicate motion in the line-of-sight (LOS) of the satellite (Sentinel-1 has a mean incidence angle of 38°) in terms of either uplift (relative motion of the ground towards the satellite) or sinking (relative motion of the ground away from the satellite). If the interferogram phase changes from 0 to -3.14 (cycles in the negative direction), the surface is moving away from the satellite (i.e., sinking movement). Vice versa, if cycles go in the positive direction (from 0 to +3.14), it would mean a relative uplifting movement of the ground. In areas with no ground motion, fringe patterns disappear. The radar’s sensitivity to motion depends on its wavelength. For Sentinel-1 (~5.6cm), a full fringe cycle (\\(2\\pi\\)) represents a displacement of ~2.8 cm in the LOS direction.",

    "text": "7.1 Loading Data\nThe goal of this notebook is to read an interferogram image (i.e., 2-D array of phase values) and unwrap it. Phase unwrapping is a critical process in interferometry, which involves recovering unambiguous phase data from the interferogram.\nA SAR interferogram represents the phase difference between two radar acquisitions (i.e., two SLC images). The phase difference is usually wrapped within a range of 0 to 2π, because the phase is inherently cyclical. When the true phase difference exceeds 2π, it gets “wrapped” into this range, creating a discontinuous phase signal. Phase unwrapping refers to the process of reconstructing the continuous phase field from the wrapped phase data.\nUnwrapping an interferogram is essential for extracting correct information contained in the phase such as surface topography and earth surface deformations.\nThere are many approaches that tried to solve the unwrapping problem, tackling challenging scenarios involving noise or large phase discontinuities. Here we present the Network-flow Algorithm for phase unwrapping (C. W. Chen and H. A. Zebker, 2000), which is implemented in the snaphu package.\nThe data is stored on the Jupyterhub server, so we need to load it using their respective paths.

Therefore, we have to convert the xarray DataArray to a 2D numpy array with complex values. We do that by combining the phase and intensity bands to a complex array. The actual unwrapping is essentially an addition of the phase values, such that the values are continuous and not between \\(-\\pi\\) and \\(\\pi\\).\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of how the unwrapping of the phase works.

In this case, we will unwrap an area of 500x500 pixels.\n\n# Select a subset of the data\ndx, dy = 500, 500\nx0, y0 = 2800, 1700\n\n\n# Subsetting the data arrays\nsubset = subsetting(ds.where(mask), x0, y0, dx, dy)\n\n# Unwrap the subset\nsubset = unwrap_array(subset, complex_var=\"cmplx\", ouput_var=\"unwrapped\")\n\nNow let’s compare the wrapped and unwrapped phase images.\n\nplot_compare_wrapped_unwrapped_completewrapped(\n    subset=subset,\n    cmap_cyc=cmap_cyc,\n    ds=ds,\n    mask=mask,\n    p0=(x0, y0),\n    dxy=(dx, dy),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Unwrapping with coherence mask\nAdditionally, can we try to calculate the unwrapped image by excluding pixels which the coherence values are lower than a certain threshold. This is done by masking the coherence image with the threshold value and then unwrapping the phase image with the masked coherence image.\n\nthreshold1 = 0.3\n\nsubset_unwrapped_coherence = unwrap_array(\n    subset,\n    coherence=subset.coh,\n    coh_low_threshold=threshold1,\n    complex_var=\"cmplx\",\n    ouput_var=\"unwrapped_coh\",\n)\n\nLet’s compare the unwrapped image with and without the coherence mask.\n\nplot_compare_coherence_mask_presence(\n    subset=subset_unwrapped_coherence,\n    cmap_cyc=cmap_cyc,\n    threshold=threshold1,\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see if another threshold value for the coherence mask gives better results.\n\nthreshold2 = 0.5\nsubset_unwrapped_coherence_threshold2 = unwrap_array(\n    subset,\n    coherence=subset.coh,\n    coh_low_threshold=threshold2,\n    complex_var=\"cmplx\",\n    ouput_var=\"unwrapped_coh\",\n)\n\n\nplot_different_coherence_thresholds(\n    ds_coh=subset_unwrapped_coherence,\n    ds_coh_2=subset_unwrapped_coherence_threshold2,\n    cmap_cyc=cmap_cyc,\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA higher coherence threshold means that only pixels with a coherence value greater than 0.5 will be used for phase unwrapping. This would result in an unwrapping process that is likely more stable, with reduced noise (invalid phase information in the proximity of the earthquake faults is discarded). However, an excessive coherence threshold might have significant gaps or missing information, especially in areas where motion or surface changes have occurred. The choice of a coherence threshold depends on the balance you want to strike between the accuracy and coverage of the output unwrapped image.\nKeep in mind that in case of large displacements, such as the Ridgecrest earthquake, phase unwrapping can be problematic and lead to poor results: when the displacement is large, the phase difference becomes wrapped multiple times, leading to phase aliasing. In this case, the phase values become ambiguous, we cannot distinguish between multiple phase wraps, thus leading to incorrect results.",

    "text": "E.1 Question 1\nWe have seen that cross- and co-polarized signals for Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 seem to be dependent on the type of vegetation. Let’s have a closer look at this.\nWe will try to highlight the difference between cross- and co-polarized microwave backscattering for Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 separately. As already indicated volume scattering leads to depolarization effects, where multiple scattering can cause a change in polarization. Hence, a cross-polarized receiving antenna, such as on-board the Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 satellites, may receive less energy from smooth bare soils than from vegetated surfaces. And the received energy for a cross-polarized receiving antenna will increase with increasing vegetation density. Hence this property of depolarization with vegetation density can be formulated as the cross-polarised ratio.\n\\(r_{cross} = \\frac{P_{VH}}{P_{VV}} = \\frac{\\gamma^0_{VH}}{\\gamma^0_{VV}}  \\quad \\text{for Sentinel-1}\\)\n\\(r_{cross} = \\frac{P_{HV}}{P_{HH}} = \\frac{\\gamma^0_{HV}}{\\gamma^0_{HH}}  \\quad \\text{for ALOS-2}\\)\nNote that in the literature, this formulation may also appear with the numerator and denominator swapped (i.e., as VV/VH instead of VH/VV), depending on the convention adopted by the authors. In this notebook you will calculate cross-polarised ratios for Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 as reported in the above equations.\nFirst load again the same dataset.\nurl = get_intake_url()\ncat =

The boxplot uses boxes to illustrate the distributions of binned LAI values.

The backscattered signal also depends on the change of the imagined natural media over time. We may want to capture in one single image how different land covers comparably change across the same time range. A way to do achieve that is by generating a RGB composite. But what is a RGB composite? It all comes down to combining three image bands into one picture by setting each band as either Red, Green or Blue channel.\nIn order to highlight the temporal variability of the backscatter response, we want to select 3 images with maximal distance in time. Therefore we take the first, the middle and the last time available out of the input images available for this exercise. We use RGB coloring where we want to color the first image with Red, the second with Green and the Third with Blue color. When we overlay the images the color will show the differences over time.\nimport intake\nimport numpy as np  # noqa\nimport pandas as pd\nimport xarray as xr\nimport rasterio\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom shapely.geometry import box\n\nfrom mrs.catalog import CorineColorCollection, get_intake_url",

It’s recommended to select dates that are spaced out to capture noticeable changes over time (e.g., first available date, second date as the middle date of the datacube time window, third date as the last availavable date). Pay attention to the season as well, as vegetation and other environmental factors often change significantly throughout the year.\nTips:\n\nSelect your dates from the sig0_da object and define them using the numpy datetime64 data type.\nUse the sel method with nearest neighbor (method=\\\"nearest\\\") interpolation method to obtain the resulting sig0_rgb_da object.\nDo not forget to use the compute() method (when you use the sel method) to finally load the result into memory.\n\n\n# YOUR CODE HERE ----------------------------------------------------------\nfirst = ...  # YOUR CODE HERE\nsecond = ...  # YOUR CODE HERE\nthird = ...  # YOUR CODE HERE\n# YOUR CODE HERE ----------------------------------------------------------\n\nsig0_rgb_da = ... # YOUR CODE HERE\nsig0_rgb_da\n\n\nF.3.1 Map the backscatter to RGB values\nTo visualize backscatter data in RGB, we need to transform the data into values between 0 and 1 to match it to colors. The first step is to convert the backscattering values into linear scale so we can perform meaningful calculations. Now we can normalise the values to be between 0 and 1 using the following formula: \\[\nsig0_{norm} = \\frac{sig0 - sig0_{min}}{sig0_{98th} - sig0_{min}}\n\\] We replaced the traditional maximum value with the 98th quantile in our normalization process to enhance robustness against outliers. Due to the nature of backscattering some sigma nought values get very high so taking the 98th quantile is important. The linear backscattering values are bounded by 0 so using for example the 2nd quantile is not necessary. After applying the formula, any values exceeding the 98th quantile will be greater than 1. We map these values to 1 to ensure they fit within our specified range.”\n\nlinear_ds = 10 ** (sig0_rgb_da / 10)\n\nmin_value = linear_ds.quantile(0.02).item()\nmax_robust = linear_ds.quantile(0.98).item()\n\n\ndef normalize(val, min, max):\n    \"\"\"\n    Min-max normalize value\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    val: float\n        target\n    min: float\n        minimum value of range\n    max: float\n        maximum value of range\n    Returns\n    -------\n    float\n    \"\"\"\n\n    return (val - min) / (max - min)\n\n\nnormalized_ds = normalize(linear_ds, min_value, max_robust).clip(min=0, max=1)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))\nnormalized_ds.isel(time=0).plot().axes.set_aspect(\"equal\")\nplt.tight_layout()",
